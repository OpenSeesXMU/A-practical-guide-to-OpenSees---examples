Description of the book:
The unique compendium teaches beginners how to perform nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis by following a series of step-by-step examples and basic programming method using OpenSees. The scope of the book includes nonlinear FE analyses of reinforced concrete frame shear wall structures, liquefiable soils, soil-structure interaction systems, fluid-solid coupling systems, high-speed railway systems, as well as introduces the sensitivity, reliability, optimization, peridynamic (PD) analysis, and the integration of OpenSees with other softwares. This must-have reference also teaches users how to program by adding simple material and element models, as well as PD algorithms in OpenSees.
